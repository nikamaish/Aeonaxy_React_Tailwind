# Aeonaxy Multistep Form Task


## Overview
A multistep form provides a structured approach for users to navigate and select their educational path. It guides users through a series of steps, each focusing on a specific aspect of their educational journey. With clear and intuitive navigation, users can easily move forward or backward through the form to select their preferred options. By breaking down the decision-making process into smaller, manageable steps, the multistep form streamlines the selection process and helps users make informed choices about their education.
